connman:

- The connman docs say that the state will be 'online' when things go right.
  But I saw sometimes only 'ready' depending which interface is used. Check
  if this is on purpose or if this is a bug in connman.

- The default behaviour is to autoconnect each new device. There seems
  no knob to change this behaviour.


ofono:

- If modem is attached then we get a Powered = 0, but meanwhile it powering up
  is on the way. So we get always operation in progress error message if
  we try to powerup it too early. Maybe we should just wait after a new
  modem appears for a second and then if there was no auto power we could
  power it up then.

gcm:

- retry logic: if a connection has been requested gcm should retry until
  it is successfull.
